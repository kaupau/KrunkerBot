# Krunker Aimbot (Nonfunctional)
I attempted to create an aimbot for the popular web-based FPS game Krunker.io.

I used OpenCV to detect health bars of opponents and calculate the location of their heads from that information. With the location of the head, pyautogui moves the mouse to aim the crosshair at the opponent's head. 

While the program efficiently locates enemies and changes mouse movement on prerecorded gameplay videos, my computer pleaded for mercy when I tried to use it on a live game.
